        <p id = "tribute-info">  In 90’s Detroit young James D. Yancey would be 
            introduced to the MPC by fellow musician and producer Amp Fiddler. 
            “Don’t use books, you gotta learn it yourself” was Fiddler’s paltry advice, 
            and Yancey took it in earnest. A complete master of his craft, Yancey would go on to be immortalized 
            as “the best drummer in the world,” at least according to contemporary and fellow legendary drummer 
            Questlove. From humble underground beginnings in the Detroit scene, to an auspicious professional career 
            cut short by tragedy, Jay Dee, or J Dilla, would sear an unforgettable mark on the world of contemporary 
            music. A pioneer of the neo soul movement, he occupied an idyllic moment where he produced beats not 
            possible before him; smooth and seductive, hypnotic loops and textured sounds of vinyl records 
            drunkenly punched through by drums that bumped whenever the hell they felt like it. 
            Soundscapes that were transportive, cinematic. The kind of music where you can see the video in your 
            head as you listen. An unfortunate victim of the shenanigans of big industry labels and big industry money,
            Dilla would have a tough time releasing his own music in the 90’s. In the 2000’s a major record release for 
            Fantastic, Vol. 2 by his original Detroit collective Slum Village which featured extensive production and MC’ing 
            by Dilla put him squarely in a kind of spotlight he had not seen before. His name becoming a legend inside hip-
            hop/rap and soul circles, Dilla would go on to work with industry giants such as Erykah Badu, Busta Rhymes, 
            Madlib, Common and The Roots, being at times entirely responsible for the kinds of new sounds they were 
            experimenting with. He would be a finding member of The Soulqaurians with the likes of D’Angelo, Questlove, and 
            James Poysner, and sign a major record deal with MCA. Unfortunately, label politics and business would constantly
            impede the producer and rapper from releasing much of his solo work, with many finished projects being 
            shelved to the vocal dissatisfaction of Dilla himself. This was to be all too short lived however, 
            as sometime in 2002 J Dilla would be diagnosed with lupus, comorbidly with another chronic auto-immune disease. 
            Dilla, still the headstrong Detroit hustler, would downplay his illness to fans and those around him. Rapid weight 
            loss would lead to Dilla being unable to hide the severity of his illness from fans, and he would tour Europe in a
            wheelchair in 2005. This period of his life would leave him in extreme debt, his mother recalling hospital 
            bills that would climb to an excess of 500,00 dollars a month. During these hospital stays, through swollen
            fingers, intense pain, and equipment brought into his hospital room, J Dilla would work on his last two Studio Albums: 
            an ethereal and intensely experimental work in Donuts and what would be at the time incomplete The Shining. 
            Facing another round of label meddling who doubted the commercial viability of such a personal experimental work, 
            Donuts would not be released until February 7, 2006, his 32nd Birthday. 3 days later, J Dilla would suffer a cardiac 
            arrest in Los Angeles, and pass away. The legacy Dilla left behind is unspeakable. 
            Countless have named him as direct influence, and his behind the beat style of drumming along with 
            extensive experimentation with tonality are still being incorporated in all genres of music. 
            Truly it is impossible to overstate: the artists of today would not have found the contemporary sound of 
            electronically produced music without the footsteps of J DIlla to guide them. 
            Post-humous releases would follow before an intensive rights battle between his family and the 
            executor of his estate resulting in the barring of his likeness and image to be used in any commercial setting. 
            Still fans and musicians alike hang on a thread for news of his countless shelved records being released to the 
            public, each one sounding just as weird and new as the day Dilla punched it in on the pads. </p>
